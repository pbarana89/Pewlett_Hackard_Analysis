# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

* The overview of this project was to help Pewlett Hackard anticipate their future staffing needs and better prepare for what they called a "silver tsunami", which is a large exodus of their workforce retiring leading to staffing and performance issues. I was able to use the power of SQL to combine multiple datasets to gather information in a clear form that we could present to management and allow them to prepare and plan for the future needs.

## Analysis Results

- The numbers from above show that possibly 70k of the Pewlett Hackard workforce could retire in the upcoming years. This is almost a quarter of their total 300k workforce. This does not even take into consideration employee turnover due to other factors. This is going to be a momentumal event that the company has to be prepared to face.

- The most concering thing that can be seen from the total count above is that they need to be prepared to lose over a quarter of their senior level staff and engineers. These are the people which have the furthest reach in the company and their loss will be felt severly. 

- They are fortunate that the more junior roles are not going to be at risk of a disruption in productivity due to retirement.

- They do have a limited group seen above that could provide mentorship to the company. It is absolutely vital with such a small group of people that could help transition that they use them as their assistance even though small in quantity will be invaluable in terms of quality. 

### Analysis Summary

* Pewlett Hackard has been a very successful company with a long history. That success comes from being prepared and they need to make prepartions as almost 70k of the 300k workforce could retire over the upcoming years. The senior reps will be the biggest holes to fill and with the proper planning and prepartions they can tackle this challenge. 
They will need to be very good at tapping the possible mentorship pool. It barely accounts for 2% versus what will possibly be retiring which means they will need to take advantage of every opportunity and even though they don't have a large pool if they can use what is available it will make a difference.
